## Introduction

### Goals

- Learn about the definition of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and its key elements.
- Early history of RL and how the field evolved over time.

### Summary

- RL is learning from interactions, how to map situations to actions, to maximize rewards.
- Key distinguishing features from supervised learning: 
  - No supervised labels, only rewards which are delayed
  - Sequential, time really matters
  - Interaction with environment, agent's action determine the subsequent data it receives.
- An agent: interacts with environment via: sensation ( which state I am in), actions, goal (maximize rewards).
- Elements of RL: agent and environment, subelements: policy, reward, value function, model of environment.
