## Introduction

### Goals

- Learn about the definition of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and its key elements.
- Early history of RL and how the field evolved over time.

### Summary

- RL is learning from interactions, how to map situations to actions, to maximize rewards.
- Key distinguishing features: trial-and-error search and delayed reward. In supervised learning, we have the label,
which is a specification of correct action for a particular sitation, while in RL, it often learnt from interaction with
environment
- An agent: interacts with environment via: sensation ( which state I am in), actions, goal (maximize rewards).
- Elements of RL: agent and environment, subelements: policy, reward, value function, model of environment.
